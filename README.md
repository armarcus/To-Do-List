This project stores to-do list items (as a candy shopping list) and allows users to make changes to the list. 

By choosing numeric options, users can add, remove, and replace list items, mark list items as complete, sort the list in alphabetical order, and display total number of list items.
Users can view their list at any time and can end the program if needed.
